# JavaScript Mini‑Projects

This repository contains two small vanilla JavaScript applications, styled with Tailwind CSS:

1. **Philosopher Match Quiz** – a “Which Philosopher Matches You?” personality quiz  
2. **Basic Calculator** – a simple on‑page arithmetic calculator

Each lives in its own folder (`/quiz` and `/calculator`). Read on for installation, usage and code snippets.
